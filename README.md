## **This is my first portfolio**
Welcome to my first Portfolio.
## This project was built with Bootstrap resources, including rows, columns, navbar, forms and style fonts and background. It's also accomplished by individual style on CSS, and icons taken from FontAwesome, a nice resource as Bootstrap and Google Fonts.

* The index.html page looks like this:

![About Me](/assetsREADME/1589578361481.png)

* As we can see it's provided by a Responsive Navbar 

![Navigation Bar](/assetsREADME/1589578680883.png)

* This Navigation Bar contains responsive links that take you to other sections:
* **About me**
* **Portfolio**
* **Contact**

* About Me contains the small Biography of Me (Heribert Villazana) plus responsive links to My social Networking, these links you will find also on Portfolio and Contact.

* **This is the portfolio section page**

![Portfolio](/assetsREADME/1589581023750.png)

* It contains images about an example of what is going to be my portfolio after I become a Full stack Web Developer.

* **This is the Contact section page**

* It's integrated by a form composed of Name, email, message and of course a submit button to send this information. 

* Every page also has a footer. Describing created for ... and a model of copyright.
